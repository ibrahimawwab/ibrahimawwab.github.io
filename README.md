## Repository organization and best practices
- Each major project or dataset should have its own repository with: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and clear `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if collaborators are expected.
- Provide a `CITATION.cff` or clear citation instructions for datasets and software.
- Use tags and releases for stable versions of code and data intended for citation.
- Include machine-readable metadata (e.g., `CITATION.cff`, `LICENSE`, `README`) to improve discoverability.
